				<p>Scan through the different snacks and check whether there is something
that might satisfy your cravings. The types of products that you can buy
vary from machine to machine; however, most of them include some kind of
chips, chocolates, cookies, and gums. Some machines offer healthy snacks
such as baked chips, granola bars, and peanuts.</p>
<p>Even though most vending machines contain fresh products, it
might be convenient to try to visually double check the expiration date
of the snack you want to buy.</p>
<p>Also, it is important to <strong>inspect visually whether the
item of choice is all the way to the front in the dispensing
coil</strong>, otherwise, the item will not be push out when the coil
spins.</p>
